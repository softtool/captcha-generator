# Captcha Generation Script Documentation

## Overview
This script is used to generate random captcha images and save them to a specified directory.

## Features
- **Supported Types**:
  - Numeric digits (0-9)
  - English letters (a-zA-Z)
  - Common Chinese characters (configurable)
- **Length Control**: Default length is 4 characters, supports command-line arguments to control the number of generated captchas.
- **Storage Path**: Generated images are saved in the `images/character/ImageCaptcha` directory under the project root.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: Ensure that the `captcha` library is installed (use the command `pip install captcha`).
2. Run the script; the generated captcha text and images will be displayed in the console and saved to the specified directory.

## Example Commands
- `python gen_by_image_captcha.py --count 20`: Generates 20 default type captchas (numbers + letters).
- `python gen_by_image_captcha.py --chinese`: Enables Chinese character captchas (requires system font support).

## Advanced Features
- Mixed font rendering (e.g., Microsoft YaHei, Arial, etc.).
- Random font sizes to enhance visual diversity of the captchas.
- Support for filtering common Chinese characters to avoid obscure characters.
